# BOBCAT: Bilevel Optimization-Based Computerized Adaptive Testing

This is an official repository of the paper [BOBCAT: Bilevel Optimization-Based Computerized Adaptive Testing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07386.pdf) to be presented at IJCAI 2021. 


`In this paper, we propose BOBCAT, a Bilevel Optimization-Based framework for CAT to directly learn a data-driven question selection algorithm from training data. We show that BOBCAT outperforms existing CAT methods (sometimes significantly) at reducing test length.`


## Environment Setup
This repository uses the following packages in Python3.
```
torch==1.7.1
```

## Training
You can download the preprocessed datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BItI5PVl4-iZAKd-39kjdsnHIPmRG3ld/view?usp=sharing) in `/data/` folder. Preprocessing scirpts can be found in `utils/` folder.

```(bash)
python train.py\
    --dataset {eedi-1 or eedi-3 or assit2009 or junyi or ednet}
    --model {base-sampling where base is binn/biirt and sampling is random/active/unbiased/biased}\ 
    --n_query {1, 3, 5, or 10}
    --cuda
```
